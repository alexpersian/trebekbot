# trebekbot

A Jeopardy! bot for Slack, powered by the [jService](http://jservice.io/) API. Sets up a perpetual game of Jeopardy! in your Slack channels.

## Installation

Just click this button to add the bot to your Slack team:

<a href="https://slack.com/oauth/v2/authorize?client_id=20888890816.3331520890821&scope=app_mentions:read,users:read,chat:write&user_scope="><img alt="Add to Slack" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcSet="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x" /></a>

## Usage

After installing the bot, invite it into one or more channels with `/invite @trebekbot`. Pro-tip: Create a new channel (for example, #jeopardy) just for this purpose, to avoid creating a huge distraction in other channels.

After that, simply mentioning "@trebekbot" will start a new game in the current channel.

You can also say:

* "@trebekbot my score" to see your current score
* "@trebekbot leaderboard" to see the top scores
* "@trebekbot help" to see a list of commands
